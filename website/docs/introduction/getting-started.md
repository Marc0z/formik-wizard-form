# Getting Started

Formik wizard form is a library which lets you build multistep form wizards in React with ease. It has been written over the famous form library formik and provides the enhanced versions of formik's `<Formik />` and `useFormik` hook. Formik wizard form requires few additional props along with `<Formik />` original props as well as adds some properties to the render props object.

Apart from that, the library is style or css framework agnostic and leaves the rendering part completely up to you. It just provides render props and you build your UI out of them.

For more information on usage, please refer to the How To Use and Examples section.
