# How To Use?

Formik wizard form exports two components `<FormWizard />` and `useFormikWizard` similar to Formik's `<Formik />` and `useFormik` hook and their original props have been left untouched. Rather they require you to provide few additional props to create a form wizard.

Please refer to their individual documentation.
